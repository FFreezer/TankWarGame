# TankWarGame
 This is my coursework for my third year class of Advanced Programming For Mobile Devices

I have been tasked to create a Tank War game for Android using Android Studio. This is to test and provide us room to develop our object oriented design skills. 

This is a solo project.

If you are able to read this then I have decided to make the code public after submission. If you have any questions you can contact me here directly on Github or you can email me at fraserfewster@googlemail.com
